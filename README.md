1. **Repository Structure:**
   - Backend Repo: `main` and `stage` branches.
   - Frontend Repo: `main` and `stage` branches.

2. **CI/CD Workflow:**
   - Backend: Separate CI/CD workflows for `main` and `stage` branches.
   - Frontend: Separate CI/CD workflows for `main` and `stage` branches.

3. **Naming and Tagging Conventions for Docker Images:**
   - Backend Images:
     - Main Branch: `your-registry/your-backend-image:main`
     - Stage Branch: `your-registry/your-backend-image:stage`
   - Frontend Images:
     - Main Branch: `your-registry/your-frontend-image:main`
     - Stage Branch: `your-registry/your-frontend-image:stage`

4. **CI/CD Configuration (GitHub Actions Example):**
   - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
   - Single workflow for different branches.
   - Set up Node.js version using `actions/setup-node`.
   - Use secrets for sensitive information (e.g., Docker registry credentials).

5. **Testing in CI/CD:**
   - Include testing steps (unit tests, integration tests) in your workflows before building and pushing Docker images.
